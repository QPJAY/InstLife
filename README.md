# InstLifePython

Run the install.py file to get the game, run the InstLife_Game.py file to begin the game!
If there has been a change in the code, run the update script.

This is my take on InstLife an Android Game but put into Python 

THIS GAME IS STILL IN ALPHA! THERE ARE BUGS! USE AT OWN RISK! (Well it wont break your PC xD)

Requirements (All satisfied through the python script):
Python 3
AppJar (can be installed through PIP)
